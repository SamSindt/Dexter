# Pokedex
This repository was originally a group project for my databases course that I am extending. The purpose of the project is to provide a Pokedex web interface to casual Pokemon fans.

pokedex.json and the sprites and images directories were taken from https://github.com/fanzeyi/pokemon.json.
